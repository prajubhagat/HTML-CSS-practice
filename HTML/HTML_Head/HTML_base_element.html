<h1>The base element</h1>

<p><img src="C:\Users\Praju\OneDrive\Pictures\Saved Pictures\smiley.gif" width="24" height="39" alt="Smiley"> - Notice that we have only specified a relative address for the image. Since we have specified a base URL in the head section, the browser will look for the image at "https://www.w3schools.com/images/stickman.gif".</p>

<p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_base.asp">HTML base tag</a> - Notice that the link opens in a new window, even if it has no target="_blank" attribute. This is because the target attribute of the base element is set to "_blank".</p>
